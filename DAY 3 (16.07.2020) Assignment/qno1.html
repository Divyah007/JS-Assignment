        <script>
           let number=Number(prompt("Enter the number"));
        console.log("ODD OR EVEN");
           console.log(number);
            
            function fn()
            {
                
                if(number%2==0)
                {
                    console.log(`The number entered is ${number} and Number is even`);
                }
               
                else
                {
                    console.log(`The number entered is ${number} and Number is odd`);
                }
            }
            fn(number);
