    <p><b> Question 7:</b></p>
    <p> An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything
        except 1 and itself.
        In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it canâ€™t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.
        For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.
        Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.
        For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.
        P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value</p>

let i = 2;
let count,c = null;       
   for (count = 2 ;count <= n;  )
   {
      for (c = 2 ;c <= i - 1;c++)
      {
         if (i%c == 0)
            break;
      }
      if (c == i)
      {
        console.log(i);
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += i+"<br>";
         count++;
      }
